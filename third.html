APTI ROUND
 
CN , C++ , DSA - MCQ - 5 Qs Each -
            
C++ and DSA very easy - for practice - visit
 - Sandfoundry website
            
CN - very little bit hard qs - indepth 
understanding was necessary
- again for practice -
 Sandfoundry and Indiabix
 3 Coding Qs in last phase of apti  round 
 All qs implementation based and 
 hackerrank medium level
 Qs were very easy - no DSA required
 3rd q had quite amount of edge cases
  but logic was easy
 
 Tech Round 1
 
 Ask about internship work
 Ask about languages you know
 Q1) I said Javascript - async and await
 Can we make C asynchronous - ans no we 
 would require help of OS
 
 2 coding qs
 Q 1) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-number-
 of-days-between-two-given-dates
 Q 2) k diya hai sorted array hai print minimum 
 
 abs diff btw (abs(ai-k))
 For ex
 1 2 3 6 7 8 â€“ k = 4
 Ans - 1 abs(4-3) == 1 which is minimum
 abs(1-4) = 3 which is greater than 1
 
 OS
 Deadlock and how to avoid it - told all methods
 Deadlock
 Prevention - 4 cond and which we can prevent
 Avoidance - bankers algo
 Ignorance - ostrich algo
 Detect and recovery
 Synchronisation
 Thread and what is multi threading
 Semaphores and mutex
 Race condition and Mutual exclusion            
 
 Round 2 - Managerial
            
 Explained about internship projects - 4
 Explained college projects - NoteIt , Coeus
 And also mentioned 1st runnerÂ upÂ IPSÂ -Â RSC</pre>

Druva
The day started with a company 
presentation where they shared 
what the company does then salary 
structure etc. 
Try to focus on presentation as 
they might ask you questions based on 
that
              
Aptitude Round
Then 1St round started it was
based on aptitude and coding questions
The aptitude round had almost
15 MCQ questions (CN,C++,DSA 5 each) 
MCQ questions were very easy and 
if you have a good understanding of these
 subjects then   
you don't need any extra preparation still if 
you want you can practice MCQ questions on GFG
Then after that there were 3 coding questions 
all of them were easy-medium leetcode level 
questions.
Students who solved more than 2 coding
 questions
(not sure about their selection criteria 
but try to 
solve all coding questions) 
 were selected for the 2nd round.
              
               
              
Round I
It started with a general 
introduction and then the 
interviewer gave me a Linked list 
based question and one array 
based question both were medium level 
leetcode questions he was more 
focused on my code quality.
              
               
              
Round II
This was a managerial round where
the interviewer was a very senior
level druva employee he started 
with recursion based questions
and then he asked about a project
that i mentioned on my resume so be 
prepared and only mention project 
that you really have good knowledge of
Then he also asked a few behavior 
type questions like have you ever led 
any team in any contest or hackathon 
what challenges you faced
(he was concerned about both technical and
non technical challenges)
              
Both of my interviews went in DS and project 
related questions but many of my friends had 
questions on OS,DBMS and CN
              
              
Talking about any preparation you don't need 
any special preparation for druva as such just
continue with your presentation and focus on CN.</pre>
