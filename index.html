                    <div class="card-text mb-2 description">
                        <p>So, we had 3 campuses on the same day. Forescout, NICE and Emerson. I was shortlisted for Emerson and NICE.<br><br>The Aptitude test for NICE was conducted a day earlier, which consisted of multiple sections:<br>General Aptitude<br>Core
                            Java<br>DBMS<br>Operating Systems<br>And 2 coding questions. For me, both were simple coding questions based on arrays. I was lucky to get them, some people got questions of graphs, so be prepared. PPT and interview were scheduled
                            the next day. There were 2 rounds. One technical, one technical + HR. 46 students were shortlisted for Interviews.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Immediately after the PPT, I was one of the first to go for the technical round. Actually I was not expecting for my round to be so early, and was way too nervous to appear for the round. The interviewer noticed it, offered me
                            some water to drink and tried to calm me down by asking some general questions.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Technical Round:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Moving on to the technical, he was the senior frontend developer. And fortunately or unfortunately, our tech stacks were poles apart. I had no projects on web technologies, I had 2 in ML, one in android and one in DBMS. So, he
                            was not that much interested into projects. He just asked me to explain them in brief.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><br>In DBMS, he asked me to write a query to join 3 tables.</p>
                        <p><br>He asked about android studio, build.gradle, I didn't know much about it, but I told him how the code is compiled and how the apk file is formed. He wanted to ask about java, but I told him that I did the project by watching
                            some YouTube videos, I knew only basics of Java and he started laughing. But still, he asked a few basic questions about Java, like what is public static void main?</p>
                        <p><br>Then, he moved on to python, since I had it in my resume, he asked a few data structures in python like set, list and list comprehension. I didn't know about list comprehension either. Although later I found out that I had
                            used it previously, I was just not familiar with the term.</p>
                        <p><br>Next, he went on to OOPs and this is where the interview changed. In OOPs, he covered everything. No stone was left unturned, from classes and objects, to virtual functions, virtual destructors, he asked me everything. And
                            I answered everything correctly. Interview lasted for about 1 - 1.25 hrs</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>But still, I was not much confident as my interview spanned double the time of others, and I was a bit nervous during it as well. But I was one of the first ones to get shortlisted for the HR round. So, be strong in one of the
                            core aspects, if the tech stack of you and your interviewer does not match, the interview can be diverted to one of your technical skills / core subjects.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Technical + HR:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>For the HR round, there was a panel of 2 members. One was the director of Engineering and the other was the Senior HR manager. Initially, they asked me to introduce myself. And from there on, they began to ask about the projects.
                            They asked me to list down the requirements to design an application for the IT CCF (related to my project).</p>
                        <p><br>Then they asked about what was my main aim in my career? For me, I said it was to become a data scientist. So, they began asking questions regarding data science, like why do I want to become a data scientist? What is the difference
                            between data science and machine learning? Will chatgpt replace data scientists? In which sector do I want to work with data science?</p>
                        <p><br>Then they asked me a tricky one, like if you want to estimate the number of cancer patients in a district, what will be the high level data that you'll require? They were just checking my thought process, there was no right
                            or wrong answer.</p>
                        <p><br>Since I mentioned writing, making cricket videos in my resume, they asked me that how do I use data in making these videos?</p>
                        <p><br>They also asked what about my video editing career if I get selected? To which I replied that it's not a career and all 3 of us shared a laugh.</p>
                        <p><br>Then they asked about the things that I have achieved in technical, non-technical and academics and of which I am proud of.</p>
                        <p><br>And then finally, they asked me what I knew about NICE and whether I have any questions for them. I asked about how was their experience working with NICE, and what should I do to make the most out of my Final Year?</p>
                        <p><br>I was way more confident in HR than in technical, and it was really nice experience interacting with such senior personnel.<br>This round too lasted for about an hour or more.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Tips:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Focus on OOPs, seriously, if your OOPs is weak, it gets way more difficult for the interviewer to ask you questions.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>If you don't know the answer to any question, try answering something related to it, don't directly say no especially if it is mentioned in your resume.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Work on some unique non-tech skill, learn something new about what you're passionate about. So you'll at least have something else to talk about rather than just technical areas. Both of the interviewers seemed impressed a little
                            bit when I mentioned about script writing and video editing skills.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I don't know who needs to read this, but many of you might be going through a lot. Maybe all of your roommates are placed. Maybe you've been rejected by 5 companies. All you got to do, is just hang in there. Keep trying and finally
                            your time will come. I was the last one to get placed in my room, and in the end, it didn't even matter. Writing this seems easy, but going through it has been rough, and now I know, that times like these do pass, if you're
                            having one, it shall pass too. Trust Yourself, if you can pass in ESE just by studying a night earlier, you can definitely crack a bunch of interviews. It's just a matter of time, you will get there. And finally to quote Steve
                            Jobs, "Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish". Best Of Luck!!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Each section had a maximum of 5 questions. The aptitude section's difficulty depended on individual proficiency. There were 2 easy programming questions. The OOPs and fundamentals questions were of medium difficulty. The code snippets
                            section presented some tricky challenges. Although I wasn't prepared for the AI section, it involved simple statistics under heavy AI terminology, manageable if you grasped the question context.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I don't remember the exact time given for the test, but it was around 1.5 hours. To secure selection, it was essential to answer almost all questions correctly. Many students had only 1 or 2 questions wrong and were confident,
                            yet only 6 were shortlisted.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The selection announcements were made several days after the test. Interviews were scheduled for the next day after the announcement, leaving very little time to prepare.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;The interview was conducted online, with 2 or 3 interviewers present: one for introductions, one to handle technical questions, and a manager. The interview lasted above 1 hour, the technical part being the longest. The interview
                            commenced with a basic introduction. It's crucial to prepare your introduction well and maintain a clean resume. Avoid listing skills you haven't used or are less confident about, just to inflate your resume. After my introduction,
                            about 5 minutes into the interview, they went point by point according to my intro/resume, deeply into the skills I mentioned. Be cautious about what you emphasize while speaking. After 1 or 2 questions, I realized they were
                            asking progressively deeper questions about the topics I sounded confident about. So, from the next questions, I started speaking boldly about the topics I wanted to be asked about. It worked for me, as they began asking questions
                            on the subjects I had emphasized. The interview lasted around 30 to 35 minutes. Then, the interviewer asked me to open Notepad and write code while sharing my screen. The questions were basic, such as declaring an array, printing
                            the nth element, finding the nth largest/smallest element, and some questions from the aptitude test. You could use any programming language for this part. When the interviewer indicated no more technical questions, the managerial
                            round began with another person. This conversation was more general. They aimed to understand your behaviour, so rather be yourself than being goody-goody. The interview results were announced after a few days.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;I had one interview, but many had two or even three interviews. Feel free to ask any other help if required. All the Best👍🏻👍🏻!</p>

                        <p>The interview started with the introduction. Then he asked me to introduce without mentioning technical stuff and academic background. Again he asked to give introduction for atleast 2 min.</p>
                        <p>I managed to hold introduction for 1.5 min.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>After that he asked some questions about linux and told me to rate myself in linux, I said 7/10.</p>
                        <p>He asked a couple of questions I could answer some of them, then he asked again are you sure on your rating for linux, I said yes.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>He asked favourite subject, I said DSA. He told to write any program using any DSA, I wrote a string search program using Trie and explained everything to him, he was quite impressed at that time. Then he asked some real-life applications
                            and we had some discussions around this.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>2. &nbsp;Try to communicate with the interviewer, ask doubts, they may give you wrong information and expect you to&nbsp;ask.</p>
                        <p>3. Discuss your approach while solving problem and ask for hints if you need.</p>
                        <p>4. Be ready with some examples supporting your answer.</p>
                        <p>5. Be ready for the common questions that can be asked on your projects.</p>

                        <p><strong>Managerial Round </strong>(<i>Time Duration - &nbsp;45 min -1hr ,Shortlisted for this round - 8</i>)</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>It was also a totally technical round . He asked to explain all the projects and simultaneously cross questioning.</li>
                            <li>Next he asked about my internship experience, project over there , why I am not continuing over there .</li>
                            <li>He had asked many questions on technology stack I used in internship project - Spring, Angular .How much work got completed ?</li>
                            <li>Then he asked to open notepad and told there are suppose three tables like sales, date, product, .. 5 tables , and consider each having some entries in it like A,B,C . &nbsp; Now try to make a high level design of database,
                                make whatever assumptions and ideas you have with this data and in the &nbsp;end give a product with 2nd highest number of sales in last year.</li>
                            <li>I was cross questioning him continuously , like what is this database about, can there exist sales for every product…. &nbsp;So I made some attributes and keys for each of the 5 table , told him about constraints, relationships
                                . &nbsp;He asked to optimise it, so I denormalized to make 2 tables.</li>
                            <li>Later he asked for earlier query , so I was able to make that query some how in the end , and he was impressed.</li>
                            <li>He also asked about Data warehousing , star schema … &nbsp;but I mentioned him that I am not aware about this stuff.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>HR Round (</strong><i>Time Duration</i><strong> - </strong><i>15 min &nbsp;, Shortlisted for this round - 4</i><strong>)</strong></li>
                            <li>He asked to introduce and told that he got feedback of technical part , now lets move to non technical one</li>
                            <li>Asked me , how you feel in Sangli as i was from Mumbai</li>
                            <li>Differences in both the cities you feel.</li>
                            <li>Will you be able to shift to Pune , He mentioned it was to test if you can fit from one team to another.</li>
                            <li>Asked me what qualities you think you have which would help you in the firm.</li>
                            <li>Asked 1-2 random questions .&nbsp;</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p><i>In the end , I was selected 😁 &nbsp;(Total candidates selected - 3)</i></p>
                        <p>Tip : Try to find out if company had visited any colleges just before coming to your college . And try to get all the questions from them (use your network like Linkedin) , specially aptitude , In my case they were totally same
                            &nbsp;MCQs, coding questions.</p>

                    <div class="card-text mb-2 description">
                        <p>I recently got placed at IdeaS A SAS company through campus placement drive, here is my interview experience</p>
                        <p>The process consisted of total 3 rounds and the drive was conducted for 2 days</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Round 1: Aptitude<br>There were 25 mcqs with 5 different sections each consisting of 5 mcqs<br>Make sure that you attempt every ques seriously as these questions too are considered during evaluation long with coding questions.<br>There
                            were 2 problems from problem solving section where we were supposed to write the answer with it's explanation.<br>The last one was a coding question of easy level.</p>
                        <p><br>The whole aptitude round was conducted on Reliscore platform.<br>A total of 22 students were shortlisted for next round for software engineer role.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Round 2: Technical interview<br>This round lasted for about 1 hour.<br>Was a very generic interview, it was a panel a 2 people. They asked questions on almost everything that I mentioned in the resume.</p>
                        <p><br>Some of the questions are.....<br>1. Brief intro about myself.<br>2. What is your favourite subject? I said OS<br>3. What is swap space?<br>4. What is MBR?<br>5. How does file system work?<br>6. What is indexing?<br>7. What
                            is partitioning?<br>8. How will you remove duplicates from an array?<br>9. Write a code for merge sort.<br>10. How did you store images in your MERN stack project?<br>11. On what part of the project you worked upon?</p>
                        <p>12. What is an image in Docker?</p>
                        <p>13. What is containerisation?</p>
                        <p>14. Write a Dockerfile for nodejs project.<br>15. A puzzle.....There are 10 different coins each of denomination from 1 to 10 each weighs different, coin 1 weighs 1 gram, coin 2 weighs 2 grams, ........coin 10 weighs 10 grams.
                            One of denominanations coin is defective and we to have to find that defective denomination in 1 weight using balance.<br>16. Any questions from myside?.......I asked about their role in company and any suggestions for my improvement.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Tips:<br>1. I didn't know the solution for puzzle but I tried. I asked for hint but they didn't give that too. My solution was not perfect but I still made sure that I at least try.<br>2. Be calm, confident and talkative. They
                            are more interested in the way you approach a particular problem.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>A total 7 students got shortlisted for next round</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Round 3: Managerial + HR<br>This round lasted for about 1.5 hours and honestly felt more difficult than the technical one. The interviewers were very experienced and clever.</p>
                        <p><br>They started with the utility of my project, whether it is deployed or not........In my case it was deployed which I think gave me an edge over others.&nbsp;<br>Some non-tech cross questions on my project .<br>Favourite subjects
                            from academics and why?</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>After this there were more of a behavioural questions which are very much situation based<br>1. Who is role model?<br>2. What are your aspirations?<br>3. Where do you see yourself after 5 years?<br>4. Are there any plans for higher
                            education?<br>5. Apart from academics your favourite subject?<br>6. Do you have interest in politics?<br>7. The thing that you learnt on your own?<br>8. The decision that you took that you are most proud of?<br>9. The decision
                            that you took that you are most ashamed of?<br>10. How will you deal with people?</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Tips:<br>1. Soft skills and fluent English speaking helped a lot in this round/<br>2. They were just expecting honest answers from my side.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Finally they hired 4 students for FTE as SDE and 3 interns whose PPO will be performance based. I got a FTE offer!!!</p>

                        <h2>Aptitude<br><br>It consists of two stages:<br>1. MCQ's</h2>
                        <p><strong>2. Coding questions</strong></p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>&nbsp;1.MCQ were based on core subjects and OOPS. There were around 30 MCQ questions. Difficulty level of questions were from easy to moderate. Time will be the main constraint for cracking this stage. You have to give correct answers of minimum 75%-80% &nbsp;MCQs for making your chance to qualify for interview a bit stronger.</strong><br><strong>2. DSA question were basic, but were application based, there are no straight forward questions as you practice in any of the sheets. You have to use the concept of questions you solved previously in such application based questions. There were three coding questions and you have to solve atleast 2 questions completely and last question must have atleast 50 % test cases passed. Array, string, stack, queue were on main focus.</strong><br>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Interview<br>&nbsp;</h2>
                        <h4>There were total four interview rounds followed my HR call at the end. Total interview rounds depends upon the interviewer, until the interviewer gets satisfied and their requirements are not fulfilled, rounds goes on increasing.
                            But you can expect minimum 3 rounds. First round was consisting of questions based on OS and CN followed by some basic coding questions and OOPS concept. Second round was completly DSA based, I was given four coding questions
                            to solve and was asked to answer some basic OOPS concept simultenously to test multi-tasking. Third consisted of DBMS queries and some resume based stuff, but main focus was on DBMS queries, they check how you can write most
                            efficient query to reduce i/o time. Fourth round again was based on DSA, but here I was given code and was asked to make it time and space efficient.&nbsp;</h4>
                        <h4>Coding questions were based on array, string, stack, queue, tree.(Questions from DSA sheets are enough, just make your basics clear)<br><br>Tips:<br><br>1. Make sure you are clear with all the concepts of OS, DBMS, CN and OOPS.
                            If not, atleast study sheets that are availalble online that has limited content which can be covered in short time.<br>2. You must have complete idea of all the things that you mention in your resume, mainly the projets and
                            the tech stacks that you mention.<br>3. Dont make use of such approaches or technology of which you dont have complete knowlwdge. e.g. I made use of red-black tree during my third round, because I was knowing that the problem
                            given to me can be more efficiently solved by this method. But I was unaware of implementation of red-black tree. You must avoid such things, you can simply say that you dont have any idea.</h4>
                        <h4>4. Be confident while giving answers and dont argue with the interviewer. After every round make sure that you ask atleast one question to the interviewer.</h4>
                        <h4>5. You must have fully working projects(minimum 2) and must be able to explain the project in proper manner.</h4>
                        <h4>6. Make sure you study top interview question from various sites such as interview bit, GFG, tutorials point. It really helps, because interviewer will also be not in touch with core subjects and DSA for years, there are great
                            chances that he will pick the question from these sites.</h4>
                        <h4>7. Also study top 50 puzzle question from GFG, most of the interviewer will ask these quiz questions to check your mental ability.</h4>
                        <h4>8. Even though if you know the answers of the questions asked by the interviewer, dont suddenly answer the questions, first think then apply some logic then answer.</h4>

                        <p>The questions were:<br>1) Given that an apple weighs 150 grams and a truck full of apples with a standard deviation in weight of 10 grams, what is the probability that the weight of the selected apple will be more than 160 grams?<br>2)
                            Given a Square of side 10cm and 6 points can be placed anywhere inside the square what is the probability that the distance between 2 points will be more than 8cm.</p>
                        <p>3) Which are in more quantity the no. of wheels or no. of Doors in Sangli (These types of questions are called guesstimates I would highly recommend researching these questions online and understanding the approach for solving
                            these problems)</p>
                        <p>4) As I was from CSE, I was told to explain any two concepts of CSE considering the listener is not from a technical background. I explained the concept of finding if a number is a power of 2 or not in constant time, and I explained
                            merge sort step by step.<br>5) Then he asked me what do you think would a CSE graduate do in our company.<br>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><i>9-10 were selected for Interview Round 2</i><br>It was conducted in online mode. I was first asked to write code for inserting a node with a given value at a given index position into an already present linkedList, I explained
                            each case of inserting a node at head, tail and anywhere in between in detail.&nbsp;<br>Given that you have 10 lakhs and you can invest in an industry, for the first 2 years they will not be giving you any money but from the
                            third year onwards they will give you 4 lakh each for 3 years so now you have to find out whether it is more profitable than an investment in a bank for the same amount of money and time or not.</p>

                        <p>Deutsche bank visited our college in month of July. They offered a CTC of 19.65 LPA for Graduate Analyst role. The Hiring procedure is similar to many companies. The Deutsche Bank team conducted total of 5 rounds. 1. Aptitude Test(Online
                            Coding test - 90 min) Coding test with 3 coding questions. All three questions were of medium difficulty. First question was on Array Second question was string based. Many student smart played with this question as the output
                            is either yes or NO. So printing YES might clear half of the test cases. Third question was graph(grid) based. 30 students shortlisted and interviews were scheduled after 1 week. 2. Technical Round-1 Round started with introduction
                            followed by discussion on projects that mentioned on resume. This round is time bounded. Interviewer quickly shifted to coding question(n-array tree based). I was able to solve and code the solution completely. Then some questions
                            on CS-fundamentals based on DBMS(ACID properties, Indexing) and OS(Deadlock, Paging). Interviewer also asked a puzzle which I knew as it is one of puzzles from GFG. 3. Technical Round-2 This round started with discussion on
                            project followed by two coding question. One on stack using queue and queue using stack and another on linked list(medium difficulty). Then some discussion on CS-fundamentals(OOPs, DBMS, OS). Asked to write some SQL queries
                            and discussion around it. 4. Pro-fit round and HR round Pro-fit round focused mostly on projects and scenarios based questions. In HR round discussion was related to strength, weekness, goals, higher studies and why DB. Be
                            confident and clear in this rounds. Tips: 1. Go through GFG archives - interview experiences 2. Ask questions whenever given opportunity. 3. Research on company beforehand. 4. Deutsche Bank focus on DBMS and SQL.</p>

                        <p><strong>Coding/aptitude round</strong>:</p>
                        <p>PATTERN:<br>1. The 1st coding question was based on strings in which we<br>were supposed to return no. of unique years from string<br>consisting of multiple dates(with dates in format dd-mm-<br>yyyy).<br>2. The 2nd one was also
                            on strings where the task was to<br>convert a string like 'a1b2c3' into 'abbccc' which is fairly<br>easy.<br>3. In the 3rd question, we were given an array and were asked<br>to sort it in such a way that odd and even numbers
                            come<br>alternatively. E.g. if 10 25 20 40 55 is the i/p array then the<br>o/p array will be 10 25 20 55 40.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>CS FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS:<br>1.The core section was divided into 3 parts:<br>DSA, C++ and Computer Networks.<br>2. DSA section included questions on stack, linkedlist, queue,<br>and recursion<br>3.There was one basic output question,
                            one 2D array ,one<br>related to exceptions in C++ section.<br>4. In CN there were questions related to OSI model, parity bit,<br>port numbers,</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>Technical round:</strong></p>
                        <p>Started with my basic introduction. Then he<br>asked some basic queue questions and real life<br>applications of queues. Then he moved onto DSA<br>questions. The 1st question was based on<br>linkedlist where I had to swap two nodes.
                            As<br>interview was offline he told me to write the code<br>on paper. I first explained the approach and then<br>wrote the code while side by side discussing how<br>I'm implementing the approach. 2nd question<br>was on diameter
                            of tree. I tried to explain the<br>code but wasn't able to properly implement.<br>After that he asked me about<br>which data structure and<br>algorithm to use for storing and<br>sorting 1 million numbers.<br>Except one page
                            fault question<br>no core questions were asked.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>HR round</strong>:</p>
                        <p>Similar to TR this one also started with basic<br>introduction. Then he asked me about my<br>favourite subject in curriculum and asked<br>some questions on that. Then there was brief<br>discussion on my hobbies and interests. He<br>asked
                            few questions on projects like tools and<br>technologies used, members in group, what I<br>did in the project and some others. Also he<br>asked me what technical things I read apart<br>from course curriculum like any news related<br>with
                            startups and others.<br>After that he asked me why I<br>want to join Druva which is very<br>normally asked question. In the<br>end he gave me some feedbacks<br>about my performance and that<br>concluded my HR interview.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>TIPS AND TRICKS</strong>:<br>1.Practice coding in different languages(max 2 or 3) before<br>coding rounds. You never know which libraries might come<br>handy.<br>2.Decide to either code first or solve mcq's depending on<br>marks'
                            distribution.<br>3.Thouroughly prepare the topics which you can. The<br>interviewers don't expect us to have answer of each and<br>every question but do expect us to have proper<br>understanding of what we've prepared for.<br>4.
                            Give mock interviews if possible.<br>5. Briefly greet the interviewers. Do handshake if possibe.<br>6. Have a smile on your face.<br>7.Try to maintain eye contact with interviewer.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>DO'S AND DONT'S</strong>:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Do's:<br>1.Do proper research about the company, which you're gonna<br>sit for.<br>2.Thoroughly check various options and functionalities in<br>exam portal of the aptitude test.<br>3. In the interviews have patience and let interviewer
                            ask the<br>questions.</p>
                        <p><br>Dont's<br>1.Don't be nervous while interviews and maintain your energy<br>throughout the interview.<br>2.Try not to interrupt interviewer.<br>3.Don't talk too much or too less,<br>nor too fast or too slow and also<br>not too

                        <p><strong>Aptitude Round :</strong></p>
                        <p>There were 3 Coding Questions :</p>
                        <p>2 Medium level of difficulty&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>1 Hard level of difficulty</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>Interview Round 1 :</strong></p>
                        <p>I did see his LinkedIn profile before Interview and got to know he had knowledge and experience of databases so I had cleared that he would take it deep into database.</p>
                        <p>He started it off with the first question of OS (maybe it was the same question which love babbar has in his OS notes).</p>
                        <p>Then he asked few more questions on OS (easy to medium level),</p>
                        <p>I think the OS playlist of Gate Smasher or Love babbar is enough (atleast for this interview)</p>
                        <p>then he asked about DBMS (ACID , transaction, 2nf</p>
                        <p>then asked few queries (find highest salary among the table with 3 different methods and nth highest salary, also asked how to join given two tables with some conditions) he also gave me some code snippets and asked me about their
                            output&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Asked about OOPs and their importance&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>then he moved towards DSA.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Started with why do we need DSA?</p>
                        <p>Then adv of Linked list over Array , then many more questions followed up&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>He asked how would you reverse a string (approach only )</p>
                        <p>Asked about searching methods and which is more efficient</p>
                        <p>Then there was discussion about projects</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>Interview Round 2 :</strong></p>
                        <p>In the previous interview I was pretty good at answering questions of os dbms and project but I did fumble at dsa and also didn't answer a few questions thats where they thought that they need to test my dsa&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The Interviewer at the start itself said see I'm gonna ask you 15-20 questions and I have list of all these questions, then he read out all those questions,&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I had answers for nearly 60% of those and not for remaining ones&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>So It started and questions were easy to medium level&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I was pretty nervous , was fumbling at nearly all questions so I asked for 2 mins of time so I calmed down myself&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>He was giving me code snippets of data structures and asking me their outputs , in the whole interview he asked about 12-15 code snippets</p>
                        <p>Then he asked a few difficult questions (I'm unable to remember those)</p>
                        <p>Then he asked with programming how can u find a file in the computer</p>
                        <p>This interview was a bit of roller coaster one coz few of questions I was very good and not in a few,&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>then he asked me a question to give approach using hash maps and I was unable to answer it then I asked him to give me some time to think then I gave him a approach using linked list and I kind of won him with that answer&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Then there were few more questions&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>he asked me to code for few linked list questions&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I don't really remember if he asked about project&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>This was a pretty difficult interview&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>Interview Round 3 (Professional Fit Round ) :</strong></p>
                        <p>This Round was non technical&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>They asked about my family background , my hobbies and achievements&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Then asked about my weakness (I said currently I dont have any , I have worked upon my weaknesses ). &nbsp;Then he asked me about finance (as I had mentioned it in the interview)</p>
                        <p>Then he went on to ask questions about hobbies and strengths&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Then he asked about my projects then asked about difficulties which I faced in my project and how did I tackle them</p>
                        <p>He gave me scenarios and asked how would I behave&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>He was a pretty chill guy!</p>
                        <p>You can easily clear this round with good communication and confidence</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>Interview Round 4 (HR Round) :</strong></p>
                        <p>General HR questions&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Why deutsche bank ? (prepare this answer prior to interview)</p>
                        <p>asked about my family background</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>Tips :</strong></p>
                        <p>See guys you are students you aren't expected to know too much , its fine if you dont know many concepts , <strong>all they want is a confident grad willing to learn newer tech&nbsp;</strong></p>
                        <p>Don't be underconfident or overconfident&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>the above questions are not all which they asked me, I don't remember all (so don't just prepare <strong>only </strong>these questions for interview )</p>
                        <p>Do prepare for HR interview&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Do prepare for standard project questions beforehand</p>
                        <p>I prepared for interviews like I thought that I have to win these interviewer so I did read a book ‘How to win friends and influence people’ before interview and did apply its concepts on interviewer.</p>
                        <p>This technique came pretty handy in profit round</p>
                        <p>Always Smile in a interview (smile in the sense that doesn't feel over)</p>
                        <p>Smile if you answer a question , smile even if you don't answer</p>
                        <p>Make sure you take control of little things so eventually you turn out result in your favour.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>ALL THE BEST !!!!</strong></p>

                        <p>Veritas was 3rd company visiting campus in the placement year 2022-23. It was a one-day process of all the rounds and interviews. The complete process was an online process that included a Presentation, an online assessment, and
                            all Interviews rounds.<br><br><i><strong>Online Assessment</strong></i><strong>:&nbsp;</strong><br>A). <strong>20 MCQs </strong>baesd on CN, DBMS, OS, and OOPS. All these MCQs were easy.&nbsp;<br>B). <strong>2 coding questions, </strong>one
                            was a variation of string reversal I would rate it to the Leetcode easy category and another one was a DP question, <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-taps-to-open-to-water-a-garden/"><strong>Minimum No. of taps to water the garden</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>                            it was a Leetcode hard question.<br><br><strong>Round 1: (Technical Round || DSA + Project + DBMS + OOPS || 1 hour : 20 Min)</strong><br>It was a technical round, my interviewer was 11+ years of experience in Veritas. It started
                            with an introduction and asked some counter questions on my project and Hackathons that I won. Later he moved on DSA part, Unlike others my whole interview was DSA-centric. He started with basic questions such as <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/design-linked-list/"><strong>creating a Doubly linked list class</strong></a>                            and creating some functions to <strong>add elements in a Doubly linked list, searching elements</strong> in a Doubly link list. First, he asked about the approach and then gave me time to code it up, also asked me to give proper
                            comments and asked what would be edge case and time complexities. Another question was to <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-iii/"><strong>reverse words in sentences and not complete sentences</strong></a>,
                            I gave him 3 approaches and he was quite happy about my depth in DSA. Later he moved on to Trees and told me to <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/"><strong>create a Tree class and write code for the Zig Zag traversal of the tree</strong></a>.
                            This was quite an easy question and solved it quickly with proper comments and complexity. After testing my DSA, he moved on to DBMS and asked a few basic questions such as <strong>what is Indexing in DBMS</strong>?<strong> What is the difference between an SQL database and a NoSQL database</strong>?
                            <strong>What is Clustering in DBMS told me to write a query for Clustering in DBMS</strong>. At last of the interview, he asked a few questions on OOPS they were quite basic and easy.<br><br><strong>Round 2: (Hiring Manger round || OOPS + CN + DBMS + Managerial questions || 55 Min)</strong><br>It
                            was the hiring manager round, my interviewer had 16+ years of experience in Veritas. It started with my introduction and then She asked me about my project, hackathons, and coding journey.<br>Then she asked to tell me the <strong>Data structures I know and specify real-life examples of each data structure</strong>,
                            I answered it quite well and she was impressed as DS was my strong part during the whole process. Later she asked <strong>What are 4 pillars of OOPS are and explain it as if She is a school student and doesn't know anything about coding with some real-life examples</strong>.
                            I felt this was the most difficult question in my interview as She was asking a counter question on each sentence I spoke about OOPS. Later she moved on to Puzzle luckily I solved that puzzle as I was knowing the puzzle. It
                            was about <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-3-calculate-total-distance-travelled-by-bee/">a train and a bird</a>. At last, she asked <strong>managerial questions and some situational questions</strong>, and to every
                            answer I gave she asked a counter question and it was quite exhausting for me.<br><br><strong>Round 3: (HR Round || 10 Min)</strong><br>It was quite an easy round and asked me about me and who took my interviews. Later he asked
                            <strong>how many employees work in Veritas</strong>, he was just checking If I attended PPT sincerely or not. Then he moved on to discuss the salary structure.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>Tips:</strong><br><br>1. Prepare DSA properly
                            and in-depth, will help you Off-campus and as well in other companies.</p>
                        <p>2. Always asked the question to the interviewer if you have any doubts, most of the time they phrase you half question so you should ask about the remaining entities in question. &nbsp;</p>
                        <p>3. Prepare core subject concepts with some kind of real-life examples, as they don't want textbook definitions.<br>4. Be confident and tell the interviewer if you don't know the concept or answer just don't give them wrong or made-up
                            answers.</p>
                        <p>5. Don't cheat during OA, a lot of cheating happened during Veritas OA.&nbsp;<br>6. There is no special preparation required for Veritas, just focus on DSA and DBMS. No CN was asked to me during the entire interview process but
                            it was asked to another student, So prepare it as well.<br>7. If you have any doubts or queries, you can reach out to me through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shriharsh-patil/">LinkedIn</a>.<br><br><br>Thanks,<br>Shriharsh</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;In interview firstly they asked me about my brief introduction in which i included projects n internship that i had done. At starting there were simple questions on my position of responsiblity, on my skills which i had included
                            in my resume. They asked me &nbsp;to prove myself according to your skills. Later on interview went to my technical skills.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>They asked my about my favourite subject and whole interview was gone on that.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Questions was like -&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Atlas Copco was the very first core comapny arrived at campus. Try to focus on your resume which is most imprtant part in interview process. Try to brush up your technical knoweldge before going to interview. work on your communication
                            skills which play a crucial role while delivering your knowledge and interest before an interviewer.</p>

                        <p>Deutsche Bank is a German multinational investment bank and financial services company. Generally, they start oncampus hiring in month of July. They offered the job role of Graduate Analyst. Their process of hiring includes 1 aptitude
                            (coding) test round and 4 interview rounds.<br>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Aptitude Test :<br>In this round, there were 3 coding questions of medium to hard difficulty. 2 medium and 1 hard question. These questions were based on array, string and graph.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The time given to solve these three coding questions was 1 hour 30 minutes.<br>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>4 Interview rounds :</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Technical Round 1 :<br>The very first question interviewer asked was my introduction. Next question was where do you see yourself after 5 years. Then as I mentioned about my internship in resume, he started asking questions about
                            my internship. Then he moved towards technical questions on DSA, OOPs and DBMS.<br>Questions asked during this interview:<br>1. Write a code to reverse a string:&nbsp;<br>input - Hello World&nbsp;<br>output - World Hello<br>Interviewer
                            asked me to write this code within 5-6 min. And after 5 min he asked me to stop writing. Fortunately, I was able to complete my code within time.<br>2. All OOPs concept were asked with real time examples.&nbsp;<br>3. Deep dive
                            into DBMS.&nbsp;<br>- Normalise given table till 3rd Normal form.<br>- How will you achieve consistency in database?<br>- Deep discussion about locking protocols and ACID Properties.<br>- How to find nth highest salary?<br>-
                            Lot of SQL queries were asked to frame on joins, aggregate functions and subqueries. For this, they will give you input tables and also will tell you how the output table look like.<br>This round lasts about 40 min.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Technical Round 2 :<br>Second Technical round was a deeper discussion about the projects mentioned in my resume.<br>I mentioned my top 3 projects in resume. Interviewer asked me to explain any of the two projects. So, I explained
                            1st project. He asked me the following question regarding the 1st project:<br>1. My contribution in the project.<br>2. Tech stack and basic questions on mentioned tech stack.<br>After these questions, I explained 2nd project
                            which we have built during hackathon in which my team was runner up. I shared my screen and gave live demonstration of that project. The interviewer then asked me about my role in this project. He told me to explain the features
                            of this project. He was quite clear with my project idea and implementation because of live demonstration.<br>Then after project discussion, he asked me question on sorting techniques and their complexities and to compare them
                            and tell which sorting technique is best. He asked me whether I know about JDBC. As I answered Yes, he asked me a question - how to do database connection in Java (basically, a JDBC connection code)?<br>This round lasts for
                            35 min.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Professional Fitment Round :<br>This round was like managerial round. In this round, they will check your communication skills and will ask about your achievements and hobbies. If you mentioned any club related activity or achievement
                            in your resume, they will also like to know about it. Also, they will give you some scenarios and will ask how will you behave in those situations. They will ask you about your area of interest to work (like which technology
                            you are interested to work in). Also during my interview, interviewer asked me whether I have some finance related knowledge. As I answered Yes, he asked me some financial questions like what I know about mutual funds and investments.&nbsp;<br>This
                            round lasts about 25 min.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>HR Round&nbsp;<br>General discussion about you and your family background. HR will ask questions like which location(city) you will prefer to work, why you want to join deutsche bank and whether you know any product of the company.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>It was just 10-12 mins conversation with HR.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Tips:<br>1. Be confident throughout the interview.<br>2. Think aloud when interviewer ask you to write a code.<br>3. DBMS and SQL are much more important. Study it thoroughly.<br>4. Read about the company's background and their
                            products a little more.</p>

                        </ol>
                        <p>During the interview, I started with a brief introduction, providing details about my educational background, current position of responsibilities that I currently hold, and a bit about my family background.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Favorite Subject:</p>
                        <p>One of my favorite subjects is Strength of Materials (SOM).</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Mohr circle: I am particularly drawn to the Mohr circle basics and its practical application. The concept of analyzing stress and strain and understanding their diagrams for ductile and brittle materials is fascinating to me. I
                            have also been motivated to explore the various practical applications of this subject.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>SFD and BMD Diagrams:</p>
                        <p>I found the study of Shear Force Diagrams (SFD) and Bending Moment Diagrams (BMD) intriguing, especially when applied to real-life scenarios such as a Cantilever Beam with a moment at the free end. Understanding how these diagrams
                            depict the distribution of forces and moments along a structure provides valuable insights into its structural behavior.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Bending Moment Equation:</p>
                        <p>One topic I delved into during the interview was the bending moment equation. I shared my understanding of how this equation helps determine the internal bending moments in different sections of a beam under various loading conditions.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Comparison of Strength in Rods:</p>
                        <p>A question that came up during the interview was about the strength of rods with the same cross-sectional area but differing in their hollow and solid forms. I explained that the hollow rod would be comparatively stronger due to
                            the distribution of material away from the center, providing increased resistance to bending and torsion.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Project-based Questions:</p>
                        <p>I made sure to prepare my projects thoroughly before the interview. I created a tree diagram outlining the flow of each project, enabling me to present them coherently. I only mentioned the projects that I was well-prepared for
                            and anticipated possible cross-questions regarding them.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Taking Care of Health:</p>
                        <p>Throughout the interview process, it's crucial to prioritize your health. In my case, my interview was scheduled towards the end, and waiting outside until the afternoon made me feel a bit dazed. Therefore, it is essential to maintain
                            your well-being by staying hydrated, getting adequate rest, and managing stress levels.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Additionally, I had a funny incident during the interview when I accidentally greeted the interviewers with a "Good morning" instead of "Good afternoon." It caught me off guard, but I quickly corrected myself and we shared a light-hearted
                            moment as we laughed about the mix-up. It helped ease the tension and created a friendly atmosphere throughout the interview. It's important to be able to laugh at yourself and embrace such light-hearted moments during high-pressure
                            situations.</p>

                        <p>So Deutsche Bank Contacted our College in month of July.<br>There were total 5 rounds including 1 aptitude and 4 interview rounds.<br>The aptitude round was conducted online on maybe 22 July.</p>
                        <p><br><strong>1)Aptitude Round</strong>:<br>It's consisted of 3 Coding questions of medium to hard difficulty in a time of 1.5 hrs.</p>
                        <p>1st questions was on array of medium difficulty.<br>2nd question was on string which was slightly difficult among all the coding questions.<br>The &nbsp;output was expected to be yes or no.Even if you do not solve the question
                            thoroughly Be sure to do the question partially as many students were selected by solving partially.<br>3rd question was based on bfs..a typical leetcode questions...similar to dijkstra.</p>
                        <p>For the preparation of Coding round i will recommend you to solve the question of leetcode of medium and hard level difficulty.<br>So after 1 week 30 students were shortlisted.<br>The interviews were held after 1 week of coding
                            round so it gives a Plenty of time to prepare for interviews.</p>
                        <p><br><strong>1st Interview Round.</strong><br>So In the first Round he ask me rate in Cpp out of 10...then he ask me basic question of CPP like constructor destructor,deep copy shallow copy, exception handling etc.Then he ask me
                            one of my project..then lastly one puzzle..the round lasts about 40 min.</p>

                            1-2 days prior to the visit.&nbsp;<br>The rounds and my experience-</p>

                        <p>2 simple coding questions (topics asked - linked lists, stack and queues)</p>
                        <p>Time is less, preference should be given to coding questions &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>It was quite a unique and intersting round and more of a kind of dicsussion where the team tried to check student's clarity of basic concepts, thought process and corporate readyness. They also answered some of our general queries
                            about transistion from campus to corporate. &nbsp;</p>
                        <p>A statement was given- “consider cricket ground as an operating system and speak whatever comes to your mind”&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>We tried to relate the working of operating system with processes in cricket and shared our thoughts. (for eg. synchronization of processes can be related to multiple processes happening on the ground simultaneously. furthermore
                            the state of pitch decides the state of cricket system unlike the state of OS decides the working of computer system)</p>
                        <p>and some more non technical + technical combo rounds.&nbsp;<br>Nobody was eliminated in this round.</p>

                        <p>1. Aptitude Test:<br>The aptitude test consisted of four rounds, each lasting for six minutes. Atlas Copco employed specialized software to conduct this test, ensuring minimal chances of cheating. The primary focus of the test
                            was to evaluate candidates' speed and accuracy. The four rounds encompassed numerical, verbal, puzzle, and gamification challenges. Although the rounds appeared straightforward, they demanded candidates exhibit swift thinking,
                            concentration, and precision during the actual examination.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>2. Group Discussion:<br>After shortlisting candidates from the aptitude test, the next round involved a group discussion (GD). Each group comprised six participants, and they were given a specific topic to discuss for five minutes.
                            The topics varied, covering both technical and non-technical subjects. For instance, my assigned topic was "Is a chat-GPT assistant an assistant or a job replacement?"</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>3. Combined HR-Tech Interview:<br>The following day, interviews were conducted, although mine was scheduled quite late. Upon entering the interview room, I greeted the panel consisting of an HR representative and a technical expert.
                            The interview primarily revolved around discussing various aspects of my resume, covering topics such as my introduction, work experience, and family details. Additionally, the panel extensively questioned me on React, APIs,
                            basics of product and system design, deployment, my ongoing research paper, and other related areas. I was also given an opportunity to express my career objectives. Toward the end of the interview, I was offered the chance
                            to ask any questions I had.</p>

                        <h3>Round 2 - Algorithmic Round 1</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>In this round The Interviewer gave me only one coding Question</p>
                        <p>that was given below.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h4>Question:</h4>
                        <p>Given num array and index array at every index divide array and collect maximum sum of division in Output array.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Example:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h4>Input:</h4>
                        <p>Num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</p>
                        <p>Index = [2, 4, 3, 5, 1, 0]</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h4>Output:</h4>
                        <p>Ans: [15, 6, 6, 3, 1, 0]</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Explanation:&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>first Index is 2 so Num array will get divided 1, 2 and 4, 5, 6</p>
                        <p>so 2 division we have in which 2nd has more max sum i.e 4+5+6=15 so we added 15 in output array.</p>
                        <p>second index is 4 now array will not going to have 3 divisions i.e "1, 2" , &nbsp;“4” &nbsp; and “6” in which 3rd division have maximum sum i.e 6 so we added into our output array</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>so on…</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>This looks simple problem but it is Not.</p>
                        <p>after applying different techniques I solved the Problem.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>He told me to write the code. The code was too &nbsp;complex so i just written half of it and in between i explained him all steps so understood that i can solve the question.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>They also asked few Oops Questions and CN Questions and i able to answer correctly.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h4>I Was the only one who cracked this round and qualified for last Interview round.</h4>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h3>Round 3 - Algorithmic Round 2</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>This round was too difficult for me becase it was totally out off syllabus for me basically.</p>
                        <p>I never Studied Dynamic Programming that time.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>This round was similar like Previous round Just question was Different.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Hello everyone,</p>
                        <p>This article is about the interview experience at Siemens. 🔥</p>
                        <p>The Siemens was there in our campus in the month of Feb. All were very excited to be the part of such organization which is making a meaningful and positive impact on society.</p>
                        <p>Whole process was divided in 3 parts:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>Round 1:</strong> Shortlisting of candidates on the basis of resumes. (As my resume was having basic required tech stand and some personal projects, it was easy to me to get shortlisted.)</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>Round 2:</strong> This round was about conducting the <strong>aptitude test</strong>😊. The test were consists of nearly about 35 questions.</p>
                        <p>- 5 questions was based on probability and combinations</p>
                        <p>- 10 questions was on debugging the code and completing the code snippets</p>
                        <p>- 15 questions was on basic fundamental concepts of CN and OS</p>
                        <p>- Remaining questions was based on predicting missing term.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>Round 3:</strong> It was a interview round. The interview was 40 mins long. They started with<strong> Object Oriented Programming Concepts</strong>. The first questions was <strong>design college with the help of OOPS concepts</strong>.
                            Here we had to mention the concepts of clean coding. Like DRY principle, KISS principle, SOLID principle. Means they expect from us knowledge of <strong>Low Level Designing</strong>.😇 Then they move on to the DSA part. They
                            asked me two questions.</p>
                        <p>- <strong>Reverse a string in pattern of words</strong>. (Like make “I Love My India” as “India My Love I”)</p>
                        <p>- <strong>Record Breaking Day.</strong> (The day will be record breaking if there will not be any previous day having such a reach.)</p>
                        <p>The last question was a puzzle. The puzzle was like I have 7 unit of gold bar. I hired one employee. I have to give him 1 unit of bar per day. But I can make only 2 cuts in gold bar.</p>
                        <p>Overall the experience was good.</p>
                        <p>Best Luck to all&nbsp;</p>

                            <li>Time : around 11 am<br>He was very frank to be honest and I was quite nervous because of my previous rejection by Druva, He made me comfortable by appreciating my resume, It boosted my confidence and then he started with an
                                interview.<br><br>1. He asked me to introduce myself&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>Introduce in such a way that your technical skills gets cover and avoid telling your hobbies etc as this is technical interview and not a HR interview</li>
                            <li><br>2. What are the courses you had in your curriculum ?&nbsp;<br>Then I told around 10-12 courses whichever I remember at that point.<br>Then He pulled the discussion to Operating System<br>&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>3. What are the services in Windows OS ?&nbsp;
                                <ul>
                                    <li>I first answered all the services and then explained them one by one in brief</li>
                                    <li>&nbsp;</li>
                                    <li>4. What is paging and inverted paging ? advantage of one over other ?<br><br>He moved to programming and asked my preferred langauge ?&nbsp;</li>
                                    <li>My resume was having three languages C++, Java and Python&nbsp;</li>
                                    <li>as Siemens has C++ in there tech stack so I told him to go with C++&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li>
                                    <li>He gave me a pen and a paper</li>
                                    <li>&nbsp;</li>
                                    <li>5. Find second maximum from given list of numbers&nbsp;</li>
                                    <li>I wrote a neat and clean code in a minute or two (follow good naming conventions even if problem is very easy)<br><br>6. Follow up : now He added, he has a stream of numbers and you have to find kth maximum after every
                                        insert, How can you do it ?</li>
                                    <li>so basically he asked me to find kth - maximum from the stream of numbers (standard heap question)</li>
                                    <li>I asked wheather to use library function for priority queue or should I implement it on my own ?</li>
                                    <li>He said use library function but before he asked me detailed about the operations involved with priority queue<br>again wrote a code under a minute.<br><br>He smiled and complimented me for my quick and neat code writing,
                                        This again boosted my confidence. :)<br><br>&nbsp; 7. My resume had a mention of my codechef rating so he asked me what is codechef and whats this rating means ?</li>
                                    <li>After answering this he asks how this rating is calculated ?<br>I briefly explained him the working of rating algorithm behind it and its significance.</li>
                                    <li>&nbsp;</li>
                                    <li>He now moved to OOPS concept<br><br>8. He asked me OOPS concepts and its significance ?</li>
                                    <li>answer each concept with its definition and a real life example&nbsp;<br><br>9. He then drew one diagram over a paper in tree like manner and gave details of nodes, He asked me to how will you design this ?<br>I used
                                        oops concept and came up with a class having attributes and methods for nodes, I tried to cover the every oops concept while designing it.&nbsp;</li>
                                    <li>He was satisfied and commented great this time, again my confidence increased by a inch :)<br><br><br>10. He aksed me about my project this time ?</li>
                                    <li>I had a couple of android projects and one Machine learning project.<br>He asked about an android one.<br>I explained it in 5-6 minutes, he liked the problem statement<br><br>11. He then asked difficulties I face ?</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>while answering this, I told him about a asynchronous database calls as one of my problem, He was excited to hear that</li>
                            <li>&nbsp;
                                <ul>

                                    <li>&nbsp;</li>
                                    <li>13. Follow up : He aksed about transaction logs and gave one situation where there are two tables and an operation is being performed on it, If because of some reason if operation to one table fails then how this will

                                    <li>I tried to answer it in my own words and he seemed to be satisfied with all answers<br><br>14. he then asked me like what is your image in your department and in between friends ?</li>
                                    <li>most surprising and out of the box question for me in this round, somehow managed to answer it<br><br>15. he then ask me if I have any questions : I asked him like what can I improve in myself in this final year to

                            <li>Later I got to know, some candidates had extra technical round (2 Tech + 1 HR)<br><br><strong>Round 3</strong> : HR Round (Face-to-face)</li>
                            <li>Interviewer : Vinita Srivastav&nbsp;</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Time : around 4:30 pm</p>

                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This time tell about your hobbies, interests along with tech skills</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>So far so good, but now things started going south after all this fairy tale :'(</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; 2. Did you appear for druva campus ? &nbsp;I said yes</p>

                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was literally unexpected for me and I was not having an idea how to handle it, I directly said I dont know.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;she seemed disappointed, this druva conversation took off my confidence&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; 4. Will you leave us for a company paying 25 LPA or plus ?&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Again this was out of the box and I was not prepare for this, I stumbled a bit, somehow tried to said no&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>1)Tell us about your project -</strong> <i>I had a Deep Leaerning project in my resume, so I started with explanation, and they went on asking small small details regarding the project since they were totally expert in that field, they knew about each modules.</i></p>
                        <p><i><strong>2)</strong></i><strong>Asked different libraries in DL and their explanation - </strong><i>I had brief idea of project so explained all about the project libraries like scipy, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn …….</i></p>
                        <p><i><strong>3)</strong></i><strong>What was the activation function used by you in the project &nbsp;? - </strong><i>I &nbsp;talked about PReLU activation function in that case.</i></p>
                        <p><i><strong>&nbsp;4)</strong> </i><strong>Are you familiar in ML, where you studied ML from, tell about the different models and their use</strong><i> -I was familiar with DL earlier but was lucky enough to know idea of ML, so was able to tackle the question.</i></p>
                        <p><strong>5)</strong> <strong>What is the data structure /object &nbsp;which is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types ? - </strong><i>I had worked with python, so I &nbsp;knew it was Dataframes from Pandas Library. Explained the details about it.</i></p>
                        <p><strong>6)</strong> <strong>Explain about the objects/data structures like Dataframes in pandas&nbsp;</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>10) What all assignments you havedone in C++ ? -</strong><i>For me this was a golden opportunity to impress HRs, I told them that I don't remember a single assignment done by me 😂, but told them that I know what I have learned from those assignments, like I told what happens when I make inheritance with multiple constructors , overloading different operators, working with virtual and friend functions,learned why we cant overload destructors……………………. In short explained all critical things of OOPs in C++.</i></p>
                        <p><i><strong>11)</strong></i><strong>With this interview came to end and they asked about any questions -</strong><i>I had asked like I am currently doing DL project in Healthcare, so in sector is your firm working with ML ?

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>And after a week, results &nbsp;were out, and i got selected as summer intern for TRDDC from May-July 2023. 5 students were selected out of 15 shortlisted students(Based on interview, project, CGPA total score).</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Tips - 1)</strong><i>Maintain confidence and &nbsp;smile in interview.</i></p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2) <i>Don't argue with them over any topic, tell short and crisp answers&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3) <i>For me interview was language, object oriented and project based, for some it was DSA.. other domain based, it depends on your interview panel.</i></p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4) <i>Answer in smart manner, like the one i did for assignments and always ask doubts about firm at end of the interview, to show your interest.</i></p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
